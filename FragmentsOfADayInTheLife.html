<h2>Fragments of a Day in the Life</h2>
<p><i>Today was surprisingly dark - literally pitch black when we stepped out; nevermind a sun<b>rise</b>, it looked like the sun had already <b>fell</b>.</i></p>
<p><i>And the bus ride was <b>SOOOOO</b> boring, my friends(kinda) just slept - what was I supposed to do, idk; but I can tell you what I did do: sit still and got judged.</i></p>
<p><i>Which reminds me, I wonder why it is that people feel so comfortable just staring - it's not just creepy men or whatever, girls my age fully look me up and down tutting.</i></p>
<br>
<p><i>Once I actually got to College, things got worse tho - cos my new friends basically just ignored me the whole time; I can never tell where I am with them: are we besties, or am I a third wheel?</i></p>
<p><i>And though I got a laugh from Nick's "Rizzmas Tree", I found Khadija's work as stressful as ever - I've been left with an absolute mountain to do for tomorrow but the motivations not there...</i></p>
<p><i>...Especially cos I'm waiting on over 7GBs of Screen Recording to download - it's not like they <b>should</b> be that big, but Mac Screen Recording is really high res and stuff, so pointlessly big.</i></p>
<p><i>All about College is a little unclear though because it was like 11 hours ago - so I can't clearly say what exactly was what, what was intentional - and what was not.</i></p>
<br>
<p><i>I read on the train again today - another thing to worry about: that I won't finish my book before I need to for the podcast on it for Nick. It <b>is</b> a good book though, really truly!</i></p>

<p><i>Able to get the train nice and early, I got home before 1 o' clock today; but I wasted like an hour laying in bed, because I couldn't face the work (which I still haven't finished as of 22:46).</i></p>
<p><i>I think in life I have one last hope, she's called Michelle - she's where I know to turn, she's where I am merely me: I surrender to crying for her most, I surrender myself to a lifetime of tears for love.</i></p>
<p><i>And I remind myself of what I first said for another, but for Michelle what I know is true:</i></p>
<h3>"Two Girls Against the World"</h3>
<p><i>And that's we are, and I know so as I hear her now in floods of her own.</i></p>

<p><i>I love you, dear Michelle; and I promise to write again soon! With all the love I can give and more, your Violet~</i></p>
