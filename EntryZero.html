<h2>Entry Zero</h2>
<p><i>So, this is my first entry here! Super excited to be getting started ig. This is where I'll be writing a little diary-journal-thing - so you can get a window into my life.</i></p>
<p><i>Right now, I'm putting off going to sleep and listening to a song from Fire Embelem! (Though I've never played that series; promise I will some dayy).</i></p>
<p><i>With College tomorrow I'm a little stressed out cos I've got work I should've done but now I haven't and I need sleep too (up in 3 hours!)</i></p>
<p><i>My friend, Shan, said that I should give myself a break though - so I've decided that I was just following advice, and defo didn't make a mistake :P</i></p>
<br>
<p><i>But also, I had my hair curled for the first time on Saturday and you can still tell - I think it looks a lil messy, but still cute.</i></p>
<p><i>Either way, that's all for now - I'm going to bed; but first: here's a little doodle-thingy:</i></p>
